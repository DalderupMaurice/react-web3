## Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide a quickstart in React with various, albeit opinionated, dependencies already installed and configured. Additionally, it's a way to provide good practices for repo management.

In this repo you can find:
* React, our framework of choice
* SCSS
* Jest, a testing framework
* Babel, transpiling React and ES6 made ezpz
* Parcel, a kickass bundler
* Prettier and ESLint, kickass linting support

Also some plugins:
* vendor prefixing, camelCase and global styling JSS plugins
* env and React Babel presets
* babel-polyfill
* React and Prettier ESLint plugins

And finally some testing and security:
* Travis CI, automated builds/testing
* Coveralls, code coverage
* Deepscan and Better Code Hub, code analysis
* Gemnasium and Renovate, dependency monitoring

## Setup
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/DalderupMaurice/react-boilerplate.git my-app-name
$ cd my-app-name
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

Change `README.md` and `package.json` to fit your project needs. Delete `LICENSE` if not applicable.

## Testing
Use `yarn test:local` or `npm run test:local` to run all tests locally. The `test` command is reserved for CI builds.


## Project guidelines
### Branches
* `master` and `development` are protected and require a PR with approved reviews for changes
* Use Conventional Commits' types for branches and camelCase the topic: `feat/ui`, `fix/login`, `chore/refactorHomePage`
* use Squash Merge - when possible - and reference the pull request in the conventional commit message: `feat(ui): added responsive styling (#1)`

### Committing and versioning
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/). Don't forget to scope your commits!

We use the following types everywhere: `feat`, `fix`, `chore` and `docs`. Refactor and test commits are considered chores. We only use `BREAKING CHANGE` when pushing, surprise surprise, breaking changes from `development` to `master`.

Merging a `BREAKING CHANGE` commit to master corresponds with a Major version, `feat` with minor and `fix` with patch. Bundle your `chore` and `docs` commits with any of the previously mentioned types.

**Don't forget to update the version in package.json as well before you merge a version update in development!** Because after every push to master, a corresponding tag should be created detailing all changes added to this new version in the summary and `CHANGELOG.md`.

Husky has been added to provide automated `precommit` functionality that's hooked into Prettier and Jest. You still need to `git add` these changes and amend them to the previous commit, **so don't forget to amend the changes before you push!**

### Changelogs
Speaking of changelogs! When pushing changes to `development` that warrant a version update, group changes per version and then per type. Order your change types like this (*but only use what's applicable*):
* Documentation
* Chores
* Bug Fixes
* Features
* BREAKING CHANGES
